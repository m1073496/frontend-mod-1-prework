## Section 4 Reflection

**1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?**

   This week was tough to institute the Pomodoro technique because of all the election
   hubbub. I tried it a few times and found that my best work pattern is a variation of the
   Pomodoro technique. I need to define a task and not stop until I am finished with that
   task (unless it is eating up a ridiculous amount of time and I'm getting tired).
   Once I am finished, I notice that that's when my distractions creep in such that
   I don't get back to work in a timely manner. So at this point, I set the timer for my
   break period.

**2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?**

   Setting an intention is really helpful for me, because I have a clear mental picture
   of what I'll be doing and what the stopping point looks like. It helps that the
   prework is separated into chunks-- usually my intentions coincide with reading a
   section at a time and completing the exercise at the end of that section and then
   taking my break once I'm done. I found that I'm way more focused than I thought I
   would be-- when I stick to my segmented intentions, I never look at my phone or
   fiddle around on the web.

**3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?**

   From what I understand, an object is much more complex than an array. Although
   they both can store information, an object can store strings, as well as key-value
   pairs, while an array only stores numbered lists. Both can use methods, though.

**4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.**

  * List of all of the students in class: **array**
  * List of states and their capitals: **object**
  * List of things to pack for vacation: **array**
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: **array**
  * List of student names and their cohort: **object**
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: **object**
  * All my favorite restaurants: **array**

**5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?**

   I use the Starbucks app sometimes. An object on that app would probably be a `menu item object`.
   The different properties of this object would likely be something like (with accompanying value examples):

   * `itemType = "Coffee";`
   * `itemCost = 12;`
   * `flavor = "Vanilla";`
   * `itemName = "Drip coffee";`
   * `itemAvailable = true;`
   * `hot = true;`

**6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?**

   * What exactly is the relationship between classes and objects?
   * Do all Objects come from classes, or can you have an object without a class?
   * Do all classes require object instantiations?
