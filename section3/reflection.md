## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
```
   - I really liked the distinction made between the Growth and the Static mindsets
     that are available for people. The static mindset makes you believe that
     skills and knowledge are inherent abilities that can be refined through study,
     but ultimately some people are just naturally better than others in certain
     fields. This mindset leads people to giving up when things get tough, because
     they believe they're not naturally capable. I much prefer the Growth mindset,
     because it provides a better mental space, making it much more likely that
     you will succeed.

   - I also really liked their discussion on how to make sense of roadblocks or
     obstacles that will eventually crop up with either mindset. For the Growth
     mindset, you don't have to panic because you have the awareness that struggles
     are natural and can be overcome with a plan of action. This awareness can
     be consistently cultivated by looking back at where you started and seeing
     the progress you've made- if you've overcome obstacles before, you can do it
     again with hard work. This helps to combat the fear and defeatism you may
     feel from time to time.
```
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
```
   - I tend to have a Growth mindset in general. When I struggle with something,
     I often do something that Carmen Popoviciu advises against: I look around at
     other people and how far they have made it. I usually don't do this with the
     mindset that they're better or more naturally talented than me, though. Instead,
     I look at them as an example for how far I can go-- if someone else figured it
     out, why not me, too?

   - There are definitely days that I struggle in embodying a Growth mindset. You'd
     have to be a superhuman not to feel like you're not good enough sometimes.
     I think this happens to me most often when I struggle with the same problem
     for an extended period of time, or when I still can't grasp something after
     it's been explained to me.    
```
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
```
    I often use Instagram. The developers probably use arrays to store information
    like follower/following counts as well as the usernames of the individual
    accounts that follow or are following your account.
```
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
```
   An array method is written < .method > and allows you to interact with an array
   in a number of ways. The method you use can modify, delete, or return the
   information that you're looking for out of that array. For example, the < .pop >
   method will remove the last item from the array.
```
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
```
   A loop allows a program to run through a block of code as many times as you want,
   up to an indefinite amount of times. The purpose of a loop is to save time and
   resources by avoiding writing similar lines of code over and over.

   From what I can tell, generally speaking, loops are good for manipulating
   integers, while loops in conjunction with arrays are good for interacting with a
   group of data.
```
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
```
   If you started at 0 and wanted to reach 1,000, it would take a long time to
   write out every single number. It is much quicker to create a loop with only a
   few lines of code that will do the hard work for you. In order to write this
   loop, you need to tell the program where to start counting (num = 0), where to
   stop counting (num <= 1000), and to add 1 to each number after it is logged
   (num ++). The way to put it all together looks like this:
```

```javascript   
   for (var num = 0; num <= 1000; num++) {
     console.log(num);
   }
```

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
```
   I am unclear about whether loops can incorporate variables that have been
   declared elsewhere in the code. Do they only use the variables declared
   within their own code block?
```
