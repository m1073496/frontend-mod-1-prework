For this problem, you need to index each letter of the alphabet in an array so that you can pull from this index when you need to shift letter positions.

You also need a function `encode` with parameters for the string and
for the shiftValue that act as placeholders for later arguments that will be passed into the function.

You need a loop in order to perform the ceasar cipher shift for every letter in the string argument.

You need to separate each letter in the string in order to shift each individual letter separately.
